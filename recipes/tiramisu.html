                <li>Prepare the coffee mixture: In a shallow dish, combine the cooled coffee and coffee liqueur. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Make the mascarpone mixture: In a bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar until pale. Add the mascarpone and mix until smooth.</li>
                <li>Whip the egg whites: In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the egg whites into the mascarpone mixture.</li>
                <li>Whip the cream: In another bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form, then fold it into the mascarpone mixture.</li>
                <li>Layer the tiramisù: Quickly dip each ladyfinger in the coffee mixture and layer them in a dish. Spread half of the mascarpone mixture on top. Repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone mixture.</li>
                <li>Chill: Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
